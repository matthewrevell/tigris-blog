We are running FoundationDB in production using the [official kubernetes operator](https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-kubernetes-operator)
, we wanted to monitor FoundationDB
status. For this purpose, we looked into existing FoundationDB exporters. We found 2 excellent ones,
[this](https://github.com/aikoven/foundationdb-exporter) and [this](https://github.com/PierreZ/fdb-prometheus-exporter).
One iswritten in golang, the other one in javascript. After some careful consideration and looking at the simplicity of the
projects, we decided to make yet another one and make it available to the community.

We decided to write a new exporter from scratch for two reasons.

- Tighter integration with kubernetes operator: we wanted the pod names as tags. For this, we needed to fork/contribute
  the existing projects. Some of them were not that active.
- Integration testing: none of the projects have integration testing. Monitoring FoundationDB is a critical piece
  for us, FoundationDB is at the core of our infrastructure. Nto only we test that `status json` output is parsed correctly,
  we also test if the correct metrics are emitted with the correct names and tags.

The project is under active development and used in production for Tigris Cloud.
